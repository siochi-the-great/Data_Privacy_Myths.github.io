              <p>It is difficult to understand why people believe in certain VPN mythologies and misconceptions, yet they are false. Most of the misinformation in the VPN industry comes from false advertising from major corporations and review websites aiming to popularize their products. They spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt and then pitch their product as the ultimate solution.</p>
              <p>Users then spread the state of fear, anxiety, and doubt while at the same time recommending an advertised VPN as the solution. Therefore, many people are misinformed and believe in unfounded VPN myths and stories. </p>

    <h2><strong>VPN myths and misconceptions</strong></h2> 

    <div class="mb-5"></div>
<section>
    <h4 id="unstable-connection"><strong>1. VPN leads to an unstable internet connection</strong></h4>
    <p>VPN encrypts your data by passing it through its servers before sending it to the destination.</p>
    <p>This process could slow down your internet, as it takes time to encrypt information. However, it doesn’t cause an unstable or poor internet connection.</p>
    <p>In some cases, a VPN can even speed up your connection. Such circumstances include when an ISP is throttling your internet speed for specific internet traffic. For example, many ISPs worldwide throttle users’ speed when torrenting or streaming.</p>
    <p>So, a VPN does not cause an unstable network or poor internet connection. It’s just one of those myths that aim to defame VPN services.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h4 id="no-payment"><strong>2. I don’t need to pay for a VPN</strong></h4>
    <p>Free VPN service providers do not tell you how they make money. While premium companies charge a premium fee, others, the free ones, earn by displaying ads.</p>
    <p>Some cheap providers leak your information to third parties to make money.</p>
    <p>If you don’t want to compromise your connection quality and security, consider choosing a paid VPN plan. Paying for a VPN service is worth it, as VPNs are safe. And, of course, you don’t have to worry about your budget as you can easily find many good VPN services cheaply.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h4 id="tech-savvy"><strong>3. VPN is only for tech-savvy users</strong></h4>
    <p>“VPN is a complex technology that only tech geeks can understand.” Now, that’s another misconception frequently raised with common VPN mythologies to distract users from adopting this technology.</p>
    <p>The complexity of a VPN depends on the service providers you choose. For example, ExpressVPN and NordVPN, the best Virtual Private Networks, have clean and intuitive user interfaces that offer reliable services. You can also customize your plan and connection easily</p>
    <p>You don’t even need basic knowledge of this technology to start. As long as you have collaborated with the best VPN service providers, rest assured that the configuration will be super simple, forgetting all the myths.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4 id="nothing-to-hide"><strong>4. I don’t need a VPN, as I have nothing to hide</strong></h4>
  <p>Many people living in repressive censorship states know the importance of Virtual Private Networks. So, they use this technology to hide their information from authorities.</p>
  <p>First, you must know that <strong>VPN isn’t only for privacy. It is a security tool that helps prevent hacking and protect your data from snoopers.</strong></p>
  <p>Cybercrimes are not uncommon these days. For example, hackers can even infiltrate your device and steal your private information using unsafe public Wi Fi. Therefore, a VPN is necessary for everyone who uses their smartphones and laptops for internet banking, sharing personal information, and storing sensitive data.</p>
  <p>With the increasing cyber crimes, securing your network and information with a quality VPN is essential. That’s because there is no guarantee that the authorities or ISP will safely use your private information.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4 id="all-same"><strong>5. All VPNs are the same</strong></h4>
  <p>It is yet another VPN misinformation. The primary function of the VPN servers is to make your IP address anonymous and your browsing history private.</p>
  <p>They differ in privacy policies, speed, security features, and server locations. Some log your data or slow your connection, while others offer strong protection and better performance. Always choose a VPN with a good reputation and clear no-log policies.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4 id="illegal"><strong>6. VPN is illegal</strong></h4>
  <p>VPNs are not limited to watching censored content in states with strict censorship laws. Technology is essential for your privacy and security.</p>
  <p><strong>If you use a VPN to access illegal content otherwise censored in your country, this technology might be considered illegal.</strong></p>
  <p>VPN, in general, is considered legal and safe. This technology’s main application is to protect your information and provide a secure and reliable connection.</p>
  <p>Many people falsely believe that VPNs are only used by criminals and hackers to hide their crimes and other illegal activities from the government. However, VPNs serve a lot more privacy purposes. Hundreds of thousands of people buy a VPN plan to browse websites, download apps, and share information safely.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4 id="suffice"><strong>7. VPNs suffice for online privacy and security</strong></h4>
  <p>VPNs are helpful, but they’re just one layer in a broader privacy strategy that should include secure browsers, good passwords, and more.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4 id="anonymous"><strong>8. VPN can keep me 100% anonymous</strong></h4>
  <p>VPN service providers do everything they can to keep your identity anonymous. But they <strong>cannot guarantee 100% protection.</strong> Security breaches are not unusual.</p>
 
  <div class="mb-4"></div> 
    <h4>The following are the conditions when the VPN might not offer 100% security.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>If you use a compromised service:</strong> You must be extra careful when using unsecured websites and apps. VPNs can restrict hackers from accessing your data. However, if you use web services that don’t have high-security protocols, VPNs can’t help protect your information.</li>
        <li><strong>It may not protect your device from social engineering:</strong> Scams are designed to bypass all kinds of security measures on your device. If you let these scammers access your phone, a VPN can’t protect your data. These malicious links and data can easily bypass the firewall and antivirus software.</li>
        <li><strong>VPN doesn’t protect your data if you share it intentionally: </strong> Facebook, Google, social media, and eCommerce platforms require registering an account using your personal information. No security tool can protect the data you have shared with your consent. You must avoid apps that look unsafe.</li>
        <li><strong>VPNs may or may not protect your device from malware</strong> Most hackers use malicious links to access your system. They can also send a file or unsafe message through email. There isn’t much a VPN can do to protect your system if the hacker gets access through malicious links. However, some VPN service providers, such as ExpressVPN and NordVPN, can block apps, software, and websites containing malware or other viruses.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4 id="no-data"><strong>9. VPNs don’t collect data</strong></h4>
  <p>Websites of most VPNs are plastered with no-logs claims, meaning they don’t retain any of your data. If they keep logs, anybody can see what you are up to online, including your ISP, government authorities, and hackers. Without the log records, a search for your information will be futile.</p>
  <p>Besides, proxies are pretty unsafe. Even if they provide online anonymity to the user, these services hardly offer a stable and good internet connection.</p>
  <p>Once you have found a reliable <strong>VPN service provider, rest assured that the VPN server will encrypt your data and protect your system</strong> from unauthorized access.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4 id="proxy"><strong>10. A proxy can offer the same benefits as a VPN</strong></h4>
  <p>Proxies can hide your IP address but cannot protect your data or encrypt private information.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4 id="zero-log"><strong>11. Zero-log VPNs never log any data</strong></h4>
  <p>This is one of the most common statements VPN services use to market their products. However, VPNs consist of extensive server networks which continuously exchange data. While VPN servers do not record all the data, they often store data to improve and analyze the VPN infrastructures.</p>
  <p>ero-logging Virtual Private Networks collect only non-identifying data from users, such as email addresses and payment details.</p>
  <p>Therefore, do not be tricked by the false no-logs policy. Understand that a trustworthy VPN cannot store your sensitive data, which can be used to trace you. Additionally, choose independently audited and verified VPNs to store non-identifying data.</p>

  <h4 id="shady"><strong>12. VPNs can hide shady online activity</strong></h4>
  <p>VPNs are very effective at maintaining user privacy and security. Some VPNs even enforce a strict no-logs policy, which ensures that your online activities cannot be traced back to you in the future. For this reason, there’s a perception that using a VPN can cover your tracks when engaging in illegal or questionable activities.</p>
  <p>VPNs use sophisticated technologies to filter out websites associated with illegal activities without actively monitoring and logging user data. Additionally, a common misconception is that a VPN is only used by people engaging in shady online activities, which is untrue.</p>
  <p>The truth is a VPN is a privacy-enhancing tool. It prevents ISPs and authorities from monitoring your online activities but doesn’t permit you to do illegal activities online.</p>

  <h4 id="everything"><strong>13. A VPN protects me from everything online</strong></h4>
  <p>A VPN is not a foolproof or universal solution to your online problems. It is a powerful security and privacy tool, but you must combine it with other privacy strategies to ensure safety and privacy on the web.</p>

  <h4 id="sdp"><strong>14. VPNs are being replaced with software-defined perimeter (SDP)</strong></h4>
  <p>SPDs are still a work in progress and may replace VPNs in the future. They function standalone and supplement VPNs with intrusion detection/prevention systems and other perimeter security solutions. Today, a VPN is the most comprehensive online privacy tool, and the SPDs must wait.</p>

  <h4 id="mobile"><strong>15. A mobile VPN isn’t necessary</strong></h4>
  <p>Some people feel they don’t need a VPN for mobile devices because they trust their carriers. Remember, carriers and internet service providers are required by law to provide a secure telecom infrastructure. However, not all of them have the best interests of your data. Some ISPs track and monitor subscribers’ online activities without consent and profit off their data. When you are not using a VPN on your mobile device, your ISP is capable of seeing the following;</p>
<ul>
        <li>The websites you visit.</li>
        <li>When you log in or out.</li>
        <li>The time you spend on any website.</li>
        <li>Whatever you search online.</li>
    </ul>
