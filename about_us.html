              In today's digital era, technology is developing at an alarming rate, putting the entire world at our fingertips.
              This has created a limitless "Virtual World," where technology is used—and abused—without boundaries.
              Since almost every part of life is now connected online via social media, websites, and digital payment systems,
              people are particularly concerned about their privacy.
              Privacy is an essential human need that encompasses many different aspects, including information, freedom of choice,
              physical autonomy, and personal space, all of which have changed throughout time.
              Everybody is entitled to limit the amount of their personal data that is shown online.

            Privacy may seem simple, but it's actually quite complex due to the rapid evolution of technology and our increasing reliance on the digital world. As we shop, connect, and express ourselves online, we unknowingly share a large amount of personal data. While some believe protecting privacy is too difficult, even small, intentional actions can make a big difference. Technology itself can help defend our privacy when designed with care. However, as governments and companies collect vast data to improve services, common myths about privacy often mislead people and create a false sense of security.
